Right now I can't include mongoose schemas into the sever (they are defined on
the server).  It would be useful to be able to do so for creating forms.
- Instead I'm using a POJO that mirrors the schema, but that's not DRY
- currently all lines containing "facebookUserStatusService" are commented out
	to avoid the error message in the console that probably results from not
	having FB credentials available.  This should be easy to turn on, but not
	on by default.

How can I separate the mongodb, nginx, and node dockers, but still make it easy
to configure communication between them?

How can I fix mapping to source so that errors in the console can be traced
back to their source?

Differences between prod and dev
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - prod does not use hot reloading, dev does
 - prod has NODE_ENV=production, dev has NODE_ENV=development
 - prod docker image builds node, whereas dev container builds node
 - prod runs node using ps2, dev runs it directly
 - prod runs node on container startup, dev starts container, then attaches
   by exec and runs node in a terminal so it can be restarted easily
 - prod and dev load different dumps into mongoDB after starting it 
 - both dev and prod node image have app files copied in, but dev container also
   mounts app files as a volume so code edits will be seen by the container
